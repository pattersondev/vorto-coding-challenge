# Side Note
The github account other than pattersondev is also owned by me, it's hooked up to my vscode in some weird way where those 2 accounts are almost intertwined. It's an old account from when I use to create software for sneaker resellers and I honestly have no idea how to fix it. Sorry for the vulgar language in that name I was like 16 when I made it and thought it was cool.
